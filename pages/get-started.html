            <p class="some-info">‚ö†Ô∏è You are reading <b>NuekJS v1.2.0</b> docs... 1.0 has ended‚úîÔ∏è</p>

            <h2>What is NuekJS?</h2>
            <p>NuekJS is a JS <b>component framework</b>, inspired by <a href="https://nuejs.org/">NueJS</a> that allows devs to create custom reusable web components and heavily depends on the <b><i>HTML Container System</i></b>.
                The topic of component libraries or framework is popular with enough technologies like React ,Vue ,Angular ,Domponent ,SkateJS ,Astro ,ElderJS ,Svelte and all other frameworks built on these...
                But following this is the reason why it was made and why you should choose it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="why">
            <h2>Why NuekJS?</h2>
            <p>Since there are alot of other options to use ,the main question is why you should use it... and I would explain this right here ,right now.
            </p>
            <h3>Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It can be easily integrated in any other framework like React ,Vue ,Astro provided the use it not tied to any explicit server side framework features but it was actually made to work with raw HTML and other markups.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Its very lightweight and minified - doesn't need to compile , doesn't need a bundler, It's source code isn't even up to 200lines...
                </li>
                <li>
                    Its very performant and doesn't lag, just follow the normal HTML optimisation rules.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It gives you clean code, reduces alot of rough and headaching abstraction that other frameworks provide ,so when you inspect your website, you basically have a simple component HTML and the styles and scripts are where they needs to be.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It's SEO friendly since it's supports the HTML semantic container system, PS: I didn't say it's very SEO friendly because no matter how much I try to optimise it, it's still a client-side component framework at least for now.
                </li>
                <li>
                    And lastly its very easy to use and pickup fr früòè, so you don't have to learn anything special to use it.
                </li>
